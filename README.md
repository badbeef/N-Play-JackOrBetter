# N-Play-JackOrBetter

This is my first Python program to help me learn Python.

It plays in text mode and presents a simple interface to user similar 
to Video Poker in Casino. But it offers a simple feature to also 
randomize play the same hand 100,000 times base on the same selection.
It can be used to verify the play strategy. 

Obviously, the pay table and the number of hands it reply can be 
modified to suit your need. I will improve this program from time
to time.
